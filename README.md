# 0cps Leaderboard bot

This is a bot specifically designed to use in a discord server [Project Zero](<https://discord.gg/ywjy2Gx3>) (The biggest 0 CPS bridging server). The most remarkable feature is leaderboard system, a system that allow to submit runs to specific categories, which then send to verify/reject at the backend, and ofc display it in the leaderboard.

## Credit

This is not the first LB bot for Project Zero, the original creator of the bot - 8140 (or Vorizon on discord). It started that I had too much "suggestions" for the bot and 8140 kinda challenge me to make a better one myself. Ofc I wouldn't give up such great oppurtunity for learning purposes ~~and to secretly inject virus to everyone in the server~~. And thanks again to 8140 for helping me setting up the bot and code reference (I didn't copy most of them tho).

## There's speedrun.com already?

Yes, you're right. We had successfully request [speedrun.com board](<https://www.speedrun.com/0cps>) just for 0 CPS bridging. But it was still a fairly new community(not even 5 months ago as I'm typing these), so I'll put many experimental features into this bot and hopefully it'll be mature enough to bring changes to our SRC site. Also it is more convenient to use the bot in the discord chat and there will be more cool features other than leaderboard soon.

## commands

Work in progress, the bot wasn't added in the server, too. If you're wondering.
