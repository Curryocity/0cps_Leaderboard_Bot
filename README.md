# 0cps Leaderboard bot

This is a bot specifically designed to use in a discord server [Project Zero](<https://discord.gg/ywjy2Gx3>) (The biggest 0 CPS bridging server). The most remarkable feature is leaderboard system, a system that allow to submit runs to specific categories, which then send to verify/reject at the backend, and ofc display it in the leaderboard.

## There's speedrun.com already?

Yes, you're right. We had successfully request [speedrun.com board](<https://www.speedrun.com/0cps>) just for 0 CPS bridging. But it was still a fairly new community(not even 5 months ago as I'm typing these), so I'll put many experimental features into this bot and hopefully it'll be mature enough to bring changes to our SRC site. Also it is more convenient to use the bot in the discord chat and there will be more cool features other than leaderboard soon.

## Important Commands

- !help to seek help
- !commands(s) to check out all commands

## Leaderboard (briefly)

### - Speedrun

- Cross the island for specified mode with 0 cps bridging, you are only allowed to click during clutch and pillar.
- Sprint restriction( *tellyless%* Category ): You are not allowed to sprint between the period of last contact of island and the last block of bridge place.

### - Distance

- Only the horizontal distance(may be diagonal) is counted
- Only use 0cps, reclicking resets the distance counter
- Switching bridging method resets the distance counter

### Enjoy the art of holding down right click !

### More detailed rules would be added in Project Zero SV and Speedrun.com

## Credit

This isn't the first LB bot for Project Zero, 8140 (or Vorizon on discord) had made the first one.

It started that I had too much "suggestions" for the bot so 8140 challenges me to make a better one myself. Ofc I wouldn't give up such great oppurtunity to both learn and making my desire bot ~~and to secretly inject virus to everyone in the server~~(jkjkjkjkjk!!)

And thanks again to 8140 for helping me setting up the bot and some code reference.
